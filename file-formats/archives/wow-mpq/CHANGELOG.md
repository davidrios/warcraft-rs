### Added

- New methods in `MutableArchive`: `read_file()`, `list()`, `find_file()`, `verify_signature()`, `load_attributes()`
- Complete implementation of `compact()` method for archive defragmentation

### Changed

- Enhanced attributes file block count detection with automatic fallback logic

### Fixed

- Fixed Huffman decompression algorithm to match StormLib's linked list approach, resolving ADPCM audio decompression failures and file count discrepancies in Warcraft 3 MPQ archives
- Fixed IMPLODE compression handling for Warcraft III MPQ archives - IMPLODE-compressed files no longer incorrectly skip the first byte as a compression type prefix
- Fixed attributes file parsing to correctly handle varying block counts across different MPQ implementations
- Removed invalid Huffman test case and obsolete PKWare compression tests to eliminate test failures
- Applied rustfmt formatting fixes to improve code consistency
